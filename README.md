## Challenge 1

This challenge was an example of an on-the-job ticket where we were given starter code and tasked with improving it. The starter code we were given was for a website called "Horiseon" which includes a landing page with information about the company. The starter code was lacking in many different areas. The starter code did not use semantic HTML elements or follow logical structure. In addition it lacked accessibility and did not include any alt attributed for images. There were also no comments and the title was not descriptive. After reviewing the starter code, I revides these issues and made the code more effecient and accessible for any user.
